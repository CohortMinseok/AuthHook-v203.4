[561]Oh...you're the one that'll take care of my baby! Can you hear me? I am a wizard who is at the very bottom of the World Tree, extracting the Water of Life from there. I'm speaking to your mind right now.\r\n\r\nThat kid...is a magical animal that I've poured life into by pouring the Water of Life at the doll that I've made myself. For the longest time, I've been studying and researching on life itself, and learned to actually create a spell that creates life. But it's only possible with the Water of Life...and since it comes out so little, I can only give that kid a life for so long...
[562]When the time passes and the Water of Life that's been sprinkled onto it dries up, it'll turn back into a doll. Yes, it's very unfortunate, but not to worry. If you pour the Water of Life again on it, it'll come back to life.\r\n\r\n.And for that, I collect the Water of Life everyday here deep in the underground. I sent my apprentice up overground, so there comes a time where you'll need the Water of Life, please go visit him. Don't forget that the Water of Life will last once poured onto the doll...Please take care of it...
[563]You'll care for my precious creations?! How wonderful! You know, I'll never forget when I first discovered the Wonderberry. I was just starting out with Life Magic when I found a mysterious fruit plant that looked a bit thirsty. As soon as I gave it some of the Water of Life I had with me, I was inspired to speak life magic words over it. The moment that beautiful light radiated from it, I knew I'd created something new and special!\r\n\r\n Now, since these beings are born of life magic and Water of Life, they'll always need more of it. Whenever they get too tired, just revive them by sprinkling them with Water of Life. Take good care of them, and they'll be the best, most loyal sidekicks you've ever had!
[564]You will care for these mysterious children born from the power of moonlight!\r\nThe Luna Crystal is a mysterious gem I found while I was out with the Wonderberry children. I was struck by its beauty when something incredible happened. The moment we touched it, moonlight shone all around and granted powers to some of the children! It seems the moon had granted their wish to become even more special!\r\nOf course, these children will still require you to revive them with the Water of Life from time to time, but they will proudly stay by your side forever!

[5391]Please retrieve your items from Fredrick.
[5392]Hello, I am Fredrick, President of the Hired Merchant Association. Using Hired Merchants is an excellent alternative to using regular shops. There are just a few things you should be aware of. Let us review the contract in full. \r\n\r\nHired Merchant Contract\r\n1) The following will cause your Hired Merchant to leave, depositing any remaining items and mesos in the Store Bank.\r\n -Hired Merchant #r time expires#k\r\n  -Set up Hired Merchant in the same location for more than #r24 hours#k\r\n  -#rNot enough space in inventory#k when removing the Hired Merchant (1 warning before carried out)\r\n2) Once the Hired Merchant disappears, mesos and items can be recovered from #rFredrick#k at the entrance of the Free Market. .\r\n3) A new Hired Merchant cannot be used until the meso and items are recovered.\r\n4) A service charge of 1% will be charged on mesos left for the day (including all mesos registered for sales or mesos registered to make purchases) and the item's original price if mesos and items are left with the Store Bank for more than #r24 hours#k.\r\n5) You will have to pay 100% of the service charge to recover the items even if the service charge is beyond 100% of the original cost.\r\n6) An admin can change the shop's name without warning if an established shop uses prohibited or obscene words.
[5393]%d %s have been sold at the Remote Store.

[12557]HackShield Initialization Error : 0x%08x(%d)\r\n\r\n
[12558]Error occurs when the system has already finished initialization through calling _AhnHS_Initialize. _AhnHS_Initialize can only be called once at the program initialization stage, and cannot be called repeatedly. This can only occur in the developmental process, so no other processes need to be taken. (Value = 0x001)
[12559]Error occurs when another game client or another process is already executing HackShield. Since the HackShield vr.3.1 has been improved to allow HackShield running in a multi-process environment, this does not occur in the newer version clients. (Value = 0x201)
[12560]Error occurs while Debugger is running on the system. If this occurs during the developmental process, exclude option AHNHS_CHKOPT_KDTRACER. If this occurs in the version distributed to users, end game program and debugger, and re-execute as there is a possibility of hack attacks. (Value = 0x105)
[12561]Error occurs when the hack prevention function Driver fails initialization. If driver initialization fails, the hack prevention function will not work normally, so program should be ended, and restarted. (Value = 0x102)
[12562]Error occurs when the interface DLL file(EhSvc.dll, EGRNAP.dll, EGRNAPX2.dll) is forged or altered, or when the version is not matching. If the interface DLL file is forged or altered, this may lead to incapacitation of the hack prevention function. Program must be ended and restarted. (Value = 0x101)
[12563]Error occurs when the game code set to initialization function' s parameter and the license key value do not match the actual values. This can only occur in the developmental process, so no other processes need to be taken. (Value = 0x100)
[12564]Error occurs when the pointer of the Callback function is set incorrectly or if the license key value is NULL. This can only occur in the developmental process, so no other processes need to be taken. (Value = 0x002)
